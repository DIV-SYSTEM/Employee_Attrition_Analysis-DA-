# Employee_Attrition_Analysis

In this project, I have built a dashboard for understanding the root cause of attrition in the company which helped the company to reduce the attrition rate by 5% by coming up with different strategies.

I have used a dataset from Kaggle, you can find the dataset with this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anujachintyabiswas/attrition-rate-of-a-company)

## Problem statement 

XYZ company which was established few years back is facing around 15% attrition rate for the couple of years.
And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to understand why employees are leaving the company 
and reduce the attrition rate, XYZ company has approached HR analytics consultancy for analyzing the data they have.

I'm playing the HR analyst role in this project and build a dashboard which can help the organization in taking data driven decision.
